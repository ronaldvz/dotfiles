#ronaldvz's dotfiles

This repo contains a cumulation of the .files I'm using on my machine(s). Recently I've started doing more and more programming without the IDE's I'v been used to. I'm trying to get used to a more console-based way of programming; meaning that my .files are getting more important. 

I'm using Vundle to install the needed plugings (not using much plugins at the moment though, I expect the list to grow).
